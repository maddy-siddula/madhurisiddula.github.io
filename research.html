	<h3 style="color:#686868;"> Overview </h3>

	With the increase in the number of IoT devices across various applications including smart city, smart home, and smart vehicles, there is a data explosion that is happening. With this humongous data, the smart decisions and personalized results have been user’s top request. However, there is a huge gap between data utilization and private data communication between devices. Preferential or context aware LBS is being widely used in many such smart applications including smart transportation. A context-aware personalized route/destination prediction is where user can find his optimal path to reach a specific destination with his preferences as priority. These decisions will be based on the data collected from multiple sources including the user’s vehicle GPS, his social network tags, his LBS searches while he is travelling and so on. However, to achieve this, user’s sensitive data is often transmitted to the server that makes these personalized choices. Therefore, our goal is to investigate and develop a framework to provide data privacy to user’s sensitive data from various sensors. We also focus on providing personalized results to the user and verify data utilization Vs data privacy. To be more specific, our goals are:

<ul>
	<li> Predicting transportation mode of the user </li>
    <li> Privacy and context-aware frequent route pattern minin </li>
    <li> Generating privacy preserved similar travelers information </li>
    <li> Predicting the choice of destination </li>
    <li> Privacy infused personalized route prediction </li>
</ul>

	<h3 style="color:#686868;">Intellectual Merit </h3>
Data privacy has to be given utmost importance due to the data availability to any adversary. 
	A large amount of data is often public which includes user’s social network profile, his demographic information that is published every year by the government, his work and income information, and so on. 
	This allows adversaries to fuse information to find out about the user and his behavior. This is a leading issue for behavioral and psychological attacks. Therefore, we focus on developing a smart transportation system that combines information from various sensors and providing a personalized route choice to the user while preserving data privacy. Research in this area is limited and does not address all the concerns. Therefore, our research will significantly advance the state-of-the-art system in personalized route/destination prediction based on the user behavior.

<h3 style="color:#686868;"> Broader Impacts</h3>
The proposed research involves data collection from various IoT sensors and social networks. The collected big data will include graduate, undergraduate students, and users from various locations, behavioral pattern, gender, age, race, and financial backgrounds. We will follow an integrated approach of research and education that will enable students to benefit from the research with the aid of courses that they have taken during their study. We will make sure that they will be able to use the research they have conducted towards this project as their thesis.
